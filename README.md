# aws-terraform-packer-nginx-setup
This project automates the deployment of AWS infrastructure using Terraform and Packer. It provisions EC2 instances, establishes a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), defines subnets, configures security groups, and deploys an Application Load Balancer. Nginx is installed on the EC2 instances to serve a simple web page.
